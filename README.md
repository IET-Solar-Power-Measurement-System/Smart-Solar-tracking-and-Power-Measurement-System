ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Traditional solar panels remain static, limiting their ability to capture sunlight effectively throughout the day. This project introduces an intelligent solar tracking system that dynamically adjusts the panel's position to maximize energy absorption. Using real-time sunlight detection and power measurement, this system optimizes energy harvesting and performance analysis.
